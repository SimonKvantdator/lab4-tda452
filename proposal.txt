Proposition for our own project in lab 4 by Emma Ringstr√∂m and Simon Jacobsson.

We want to implement a simplifier of symbolic expressions. The simplifier takes
an expression involving some symbolic variables and a list of relations between
these variables and returns an (approximately) simplest form of the expression.
If there is time, we also want to implement a function that takes an expression
and returns TeX code for typesetting that expression.
